Allows users to quickly operate the mouse and manipulate Windows on the active desktop, appropriately handling desktop switches between instances.

Features:

* The application is aware of the desktop that is running and the desktop it started on.  Only one instance per desktop may be run at one time.
* Detection of the Window under the cursor.  Allowing manipulation of Windows, including closing, moving, resizing, pushing (to the back of the z-order), pulling (to the top of the z-order), maximizing, restoring, and minimizing.
* XInput events can be configured to trigger simulated mouse and keyboard events.
* A wide range of speed and acceleration settings can be applied to the simulated events.
* XInput buttons can be remapped to different functions.
* Thumbsticks and Triggers can be calibrated to ignore dead zones.
