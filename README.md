# WindowGamepad
XInput mouse interface for "Xbox one" controllers and "Xbox adaptive controller".

Allows users to quickly operate the mouse and manipulate the state of Windows on the desktop.

To disconnect xinput to apps use WTSDiscconect.exe.  This will allow the Mouse-Only setting in the button mapping dialog window.  You can navigate app Windows with the mouse rather than the silly selector rectangle.
