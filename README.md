# WindowGamepad
XInput mouse interface for "Xbox one" controllers and "Xbox adaptive controller".

Allows users to quickly operate the mouse and manipulate the state of Windows on the desktop.

To disconnect xinput to apps press the lock button on the alternate desktop shell (start menu).  This will allow the Mouse-Only option in button mapping.  Navigate app Windows with the mouse rather than the selector rectangle.
